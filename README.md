##AI financial advisor that democratizes wealth management!


Meet "Coyn" - your 24/7 pocket strategist for retirement planning, portfolio optimization, and smart money decisions.


###💡The Problem
Wealth management has long been reserved for the ultra-wealthy, while most juggle generic advice and spreadsheet chaos. "Coyn" is my attempt to bridge this gap. An AI co-pilot that combines institutional-grade methodology with everyday usability.

▸ Portfolio Breakdown: Equity, crypto, real estate, bonds
